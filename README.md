## How It's Made: 

**Tech Used: JavaScript, Node, Express, React, Mongoose, MongoDB, Passport

The website provides users with the ability to create an account and maintain a personal list of tasks to complete. It features a Pomodoro timer, enabling users to switch between work and break times. Users can mark tasks as complete and remove them from the list.


## Optimization: 

Prevent the timer from resetting when a PUT request is made to the server by moving its values from localStorage to a separate collection in the database with a user identifier. <br />
Refactor the UI for a cleaner look.


## Lessons Learned: 

Implementing user authentication and maintaining personalized lists. <br />
React and MVC organization practice.
